# Love Letter

Dotnet core OO modelling of Love Letter.

## Components

2 - 4 players.

16 cards numbered from 1 - 7

## Objective

Eliminate all players or have the highest numbere card at the end of the game.

## Setup 

- Shuffle the cards
- Remove 1 card from the game
- If it's a 2 player game, removes 2 cards from the game and place them face up for both players to see.
- Deal out one card to each player

## Rounds 

### Taking a turn

- Draw the top card from the deck and add it to your
hand.
- Then choose one of the two cards in your hand and discard it face up in front of you. 
- Apply any effect on the card you discarded.
- You must apply its effect, even if it is bad for you. 
- Discarded cards must be laid out in front of each player, in the order they were discarded.

### Knocked out players

Some card effects may cause a player to be knocked out. This player discards their cards and does not apply the effect.

### End of a round

The round ends when the deck is empty. 

The players compare hands and the player with the highest value wins. This player recieves a 'token of affection'.

We then do the setup phase once more.

## End of the Game

The game ends when a player has recieved a certain number of tokens of affection.

- There are 13 'tokens of affection'. 
- Take this number and divide it by the number of players plus 1. 
- This is the amount needed to win the game. 
    * 2 players = (13 / 2) + 1 = 6.
    * 3 players = (13 / 3) + 1 = 5.
    * 4 players = (13 / 4) + 1 = 3.
